This is an updated version of the Raphael.group.js plugin. It adds support for moving groups and scaling the X and Y axis independently. 

WARNING: These plugins were not tested in IE, and I don't care.

These are plugins I've created for the RaphaelJS library (raphaeljs.com) for my own personal use. Feel free to use them as well.
